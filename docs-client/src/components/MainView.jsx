        <Heading2>How the Guides Are Organized</Heading2>
        <Paragraph>
        The guides are documentation that explain how to use Dataverse, which are divided into the following sections: User Guide, Installation Guide, Developer Guide, API Guide, Style Guide and Container Guide. The User Guide is further divided into primary activities: finding & using data, adding Datasets, administering dataverses or Datasets, and Dataset exploration/visualizations. Details on all of the above tasks can be found in the Users Guide. The Installation Guide is for people or organizations who want to host their own Dataverse. The Container Guide gives information on how to deploy Dataverse with containers. The Developer Guide contains instructions for people who want to contribute to the Open Source Dataverse project or who want to modify the code to suit their own needs. Finally, the API Guide is for Developers that work on other applications and are interested in connecting with Dataverse through our APIs.
